<p>The Ramayana Ramayana also known as Valmiki Ramayana, as traditionally attributed to Valmiki, is a Sanskrit epic from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism known as the Itihasas, the other being the Mahabharata. The epic, narrates the life of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya in the kingdom of Kosala. The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across forests in the Indian subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana; the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana, the king of Lanka, that resulted in war; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya along with Sita to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration.</p>
